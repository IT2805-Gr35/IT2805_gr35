        <p>We have all learned alot in this project. In termes of programming we have come a long way with both CSS, html and especially JavaSript. Our mockups where really simple compared to how our page turned out, but we are really happy with the result. It was hard to imagene how the website design should look before we started programming and trying out different implementations. Things took alot longer time than we initially thought. We have had meeting every week since the beginning of the project, and this really helped us with setting off time to work with the project even though the deadline was months away. The project have teached us alot about teamwork and responsebility.</p>
