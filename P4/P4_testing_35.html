        <h2>3. Testing Document</h2>
        <p>We used the form found on this adress: https://forms.gle/dagnQ5pF1nBYJrqSA</p>
        <p>To summarize, this form collected some general information about each user such as age group, occupation, what platform was used to access the site.
            Following this, the user was asked to rate the user experience in the categories: navigation, visual design and overall user experience. 
            This feedback was recorded both numerical with ranges from 1-6, and in plaintext asking the user to highlight areas that stood out in either direction. 
            Thus, we could gain an good overall understanding of the user experience, and find which areas needed the most attention going forward. </p>

        <h2>6. Feedback Summary</h2>
        <h3>Navigation:</h3>
            <p>Positive:
                Some users remarked that the navigation was very simple and intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>Negative:
                Could make it more obvious that elements were meant for navigation, eg. highlight them more when hovering to make them seem more clickable. 
            </p>
        <h3>Visual design:</h3>
            <p>Positive: 
                In general, users remarked that the overall visual apperance was coherant and worked well togeather.
            </p>
            <p>Negative:
                Some felt there was too much brown on the website, and that the slideshows on the info pages were distracting.
                A few mobile users remarked that contents appeared a bit small, and could be scaled better. 
                One user reccomended removing the spaces between the individual searchbox items in the dropdown menu.          
            </p>
        <h3>Content:</h3>
            <p>Positive:
                Users indicated that it was very easy to see what was in season, and were overall very pleased with the contents of our website.
            </p>
            <p>Negative:</p>
        <h3>Overall:</h3>
            <p>Positive: 
                Genereally very positive and encouraging feedback, and it seemed users left the website with a positive experience.
                Users especially highlighted the searchbar, and that the website felt fast and responsive.
            </p>
            <p>Negative:

        <h2>7. Your Response</h2>
        <p>
            We were very grateful and fortunate to have recieved very honest and detailed feedback. 
            Overall, we feel that most of the suggestions from users were specific details and preferences that could be adjusted in the short term. 
            As there were still some minor changes applied during the testing phase, some of the issues raised were expected. 
            Based on the feedback recieved, it appears that the visual design requires the most work. 
            Here we could, time allowing, refine and sharpen our design to both better suit mobile users, aswell as giving it a more universial appeal. 
            For instance, we could consider changing the colour-theme of the website, and optimize the css-styling to suit mobile.
            Furthermore, none of the suggested changes were precieved to be outside the scope of our current skillsets, and the group feels that we could sufficiently adress the changes.

        <h2>8. Self Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, we have all learned alot in this project. 
            In terms of programming every team member has come a long way with both CSS, html and especially JavaSript. 
            Our mockups were really simple in comparison with our final page, but we are really happy with the result. 
            We found it was hard to imagene how the website design should look before we started programming and trying out different implementations. 
            It was this discovery that lead to our departure from the mockups, resulting in a website that works and flows better in a real-world scenario. 
            Furthermore, many steps of the project took alot longer to complete than we initially thought. 
            To counteract this, we decided to meet weekly since the beginning of the project. 
            This really helped us with dedicating time to working on the project evenly although the deadline was months away. 
            Even with our approach, in hindsight we would have worked hard to complete the P3 coding earlier, to give more time to user testing in P4. 
            We found that getting the website to a place were it could be test-ready was a long process, with several unexpected setbacks and bugs. 
            The project has teached us alot about teamwork and responsebility, and more specifically about these themes when working on an actual IT-project.
            We have been exposed to valuable platforms like Git and Figma, on which communication and cooporation could be effectivized.
            Along the way we have grown closer together, helped and supported each other, and encouraged creativity and initiative. 
            Therefore we have been very happy with the group dynamic, and feel that each member has overcome challenges and contributed in a very satisfying way. 
            One observation is that it can sometimes be hard to allocate time to a project that is pass/fail, in comparison with a graded project. 
            Some group members had pressing dedlines for tasks that demanded a greater focus, as the stakes were higher.
            Thus, we had to work around this in the completion of the website.
