        <p>We used the form found on this adress: https://forms.gle/dagnQ5pF1nBYJrqSA</p>
        <p>To summarize, this form collected some general information about each user such as age group, occupation, what platform was used to access the site.
            Following this, the user was asked to rate the user experience in the categories: navigation, visual design and overall user experience. 
            This feedback was recorded both numerical with ranges from 1-6, and in plaintext asking the user to highlight areas that stood out in either direction. 
            Thus, we could gain an good overall understanding of the user experience, and find which areas needed the most attention going forward. </p>
