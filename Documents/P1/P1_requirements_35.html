        <p>Our (imaginary) client, “Norsk Natur for Turister”, is an organization working to promote and encourage leisurely activity in the Norwegian nature. 
            In order to make nature accessible to a wider audience, the organization strives to highlight various natural treasures in user friendly and comprehensible digital formats. 
            This website is a part of an ongoing campaign tailored to an international audience, more specifically tourists looking for a unique Norwegian nature experience. 
            Consequently, the website is written in English.  </p>

        <h2>Purpose and goals </h2>
        <p>The purpose of the website is to endorse safe harvest of in-season wild berries, fruit and mushrooms. Thus, the website will attempt to make harvesting accessible to a wider audience, by lowering the knowledge threshold associated with harvest of edible goods. This is accomplished by giving information about which food-safe specimens are-, or will be, in season at a given time. </p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
            This website is primarily directed towards English speaking tourists, international or national, looking to experience harvesting edible goods in the Norwegian nature. 
            It will be directed at beginners, with no pervious harvesting experience required. 
            Therefore, the targeted audience is dependent on a simple and visual interface, such that the various specimens are displayed not only through text.
