        <p>Our (imaginary) client, “Norsk Natur for Turister”, is an organization working to promote and encourage leisurely activity in the Norwegian nature. 
            In order to make nature accessible to a wider audience, the organization strives to highlight various natural treasures in user friendly and comprehensible digital formats. 
            This website is a part of an ongoing campaign tailored to an international audience, more specifically tourists looking for a unique Norwegian nature experience. 
            Consequently, the website is written in English.  </p>

        <h2>Purpose and goals </h2>
        <p>The purpose of the website is to endorse safe harvest of in-season wild berries, fruit and mushrooms. Thus, the website will attempt to make harvesting accessible to a wider audience, by lowering the knowledge threshold associated with harvest of edible goods. This is accomplished by giving information about which food-safe specimens are-, or will be, in season at a given time. </p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
            This website is primarily directed towards English speaking tourists, international or national, looking to experience harvesting edible goods in the Norwegian nature. 
            It will be directed at beginners, with no pervious harvesting experience required. 
            Therefore, the targeted audience is dependent on a simple and visual interface, such that the various specimens are displayed not only through text.

                <li>Main page
                    <p>The main page is what you first see when visiting the main page. 
                        This page will show berries, mushrooms and fruit that are in season at the time. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Fruit / Berries / Mushrooms
                    <p>There will be three separate pages, one for each of them. These will contain a list of plants for each category, 
                        where people can quickly see picture, name, what dates they are in season and a small status light witch shows green 
                        if it's in season, and red if it's out of season. Here people can also click on the different pages and come to a page 
                        where they can read more information about the plant, and maybe what they can be used for.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Laws
                    <p>This page will contain the laws which are relevant for harvesting plants in Norwegian nature and links to the web pages

                        will also be provided in this section. This page will help spread awareness about the organization. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Get info on a plant
                    <p>This is a page the client wanted where people can send in a form containing a picture of a plant and some basic information about it, 
                        then this will be sent off to one of the organizations' many professional botanists. The botanist will then be able to contact the 
                        person who sent in information and help them identify said plant.</p>
