                    Mullets, which are a little more exclusive than other berries. No wonder that those who know about a good mullet bog like to keep it to themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>
                    Mullets are eaten naturally with cream and sugar or as mullet cream. Mullets can also be used as cake filling, in cheese, pie or as jam. Mullets can be frozen for later use.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    Mullets have a high content of vitamin C, which strengthens the immune system and increases the absorption of iron from other foods. Mullet is also a source of vitamin E, which helps protect cells from oxidative stress, as well as a source of folate, which helps reduce fatigue and exhaustion. Mullets also have a high dietary fiber content, which is beneficial for digestion.
                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Fresh mullets must be clean and ripe with a good yellow colour. Fermentation, mold or rot must not occur.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    Fresh mullets have a high content of a preservative called benzoic acid, which means that they can be kept at refrigerator temperature for a certain time. We would still recommend freezing them to avoid them starting to ferment.</p>
