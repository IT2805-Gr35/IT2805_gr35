                    Pineapple has a high content of vitamin C. Vitamin C contributes to the normal functioning of the immune system and protects the cells against oxidative stress. Vitamin C increases the absorption of iron from other foods you eat and contributes to the formation of collagen, which is important for gums, teeth and skin. Vitamin C also contributes to normal energy metabolism. Pineapple also has a high content of dietary fiber which is beneficial for digestion.

                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.
