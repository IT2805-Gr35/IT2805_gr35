                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>Pear is one of the oldest fruits we know of and cultivation is said to have taken place as early as 3000 BC. In this country, the fruit has been known since the Middle Ages and is found today in a number of different varieties. Ingeborg and Celina are the largest Norwegian varieties.
                    Most of the bulbs sold in Norway are imported. Pears require a warmer and drier climate than apples and production in Norway is small. Most pears are green in the shell, but there are also red, brown and yellow-green ones. The flesh is white and hard before the pear is ripe. Ripe pears are soft and juicy with an aromatic taste.

                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>
                    Pear is eaten natural. It tastes best when ripe and can easily be re-ripened at room temperature if it is hard. If the pear is ripe, it should not be left for long before it is eaten. Pear goes well as a snack, after a meal or with cheese. Pears can also be used in fruit salad, in pastries, desserts, pies or canned.

                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    Pear has a low fat content and high dietary fiber content. Dietary fiber is beneficial for digestion.
                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Pear must be firm in consistency and free from impact damage. It must be whole, have the stem on and show no signs of shrinkage or dark spots in the shell. The quality can vary in relation to variety and place of cultivation. Shape, color and taste must be typical of the variety and the size in the box must be uniform.

                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    1 - 2°C
                    Shelf life of pears can vary somewhat in relation to variety, country of cultivation and storage conditions. For all storage, it is important to keep the temperature as low as possible and have the right humidity. Pears are sensitive to ethylene and must not be stored together with apples or other fruits that secrete ethylene.</p>
