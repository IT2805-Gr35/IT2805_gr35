        <h3 id="infoSub">Blackberries look like rather large, black raspberries. They have a juicy and sour taste, with some sweetness. It's absolutely lovely to just eat blackberries on their own, but also try them in a wonderful game sauce. It's amazing!</h3>

                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>Blackberries are in shape and form a mixture of raspberries and mulberries, but the color is from dark violet to almost black. The taste is also somewhat less sweet than other berry types.
                    Blackberries grow wild in Northern Europe, Asia and America. Even in the south of Norway we can find wild blackberries. While raspberries detach from the berry cap when ripening and are hollow inside, the berry cap is fixed in the blackberry even after ripening. Both berries and berry juice must be eaten. There are several varieties of blackberries in terms of shape, color and size.

                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>
                    Blackberries go well as an accompaniment to ice cream or yogurt. Fruit salad with blackberries can also be recommended. Blackberries are also suitable for tarts, cakes and pies. They can also be eaten plain with a little sugar and cream or heated into ice cream.

                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    Blackberries are a source of vitamin C and copper, as well as having a high content of dietary fibre. Vitamin C strengthens the immune system and increases the absorption of iron from other foods. Dietary fiber is beneficial for digestion.

                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Blackberries often have a better shelf life than other berry varieties. They must have a uniform dark color with a shiny and fresh appearance without any hint of damage.

                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    0 - 2°C

                    Fresh blackberries have a short shelf life and are not suitable for storage. They should be frozen if not used within a few days.
