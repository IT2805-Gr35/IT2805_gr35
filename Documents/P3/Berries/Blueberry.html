                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>Blueberries are best known in Norway as the wild growing berry we find in the woods in late summer. This is a berry with a red-blue pulp.
                    Blueberries grown on bushes or so-called garden blueberries are the most sold in the retail trade. Compared to forest blueberries, garden blueberries are larger, sweeter and with a milder aroma. The blue color is limited to the skin, so you don't get that blue on your tongue from eating garden blueberries.

                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>
                    Blueberries are eaten fresh as a snack or as a dessert with milk and sugar. Blueberries can also be used in fruit salads, blueberry pie and in breakfast cereals. It is an old tradition in Norway to make juice and jam from wild blueberries. Blueberry juice is delicious as a drink and blueberry jam is often a favorite on pancakes and waffles. Can also be frozen.                    <br>

                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    Blueberries are a source of vitamin E, vitamin C and folate. In addition, blueberries have a high content of dietary fibre. Vitamin E helps to protect the cells against oxidative stress, while vitamin C strengthens the immune system and increases the absorption of iron from other foods. Folate helps to reduce fatigue and exhaustion, while dietary fiber is good for digestion.

                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Blueberries must have a dark blue color on the skin, they must be glossy, dry and firm. The berries must not be soft or show signs of shrinkage.                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    Fresh blueberries - both garden blueberries and forest blueberries - have a short shelf life and are not suitable for storage. They should be frozen if not used within a few days.            </div>
