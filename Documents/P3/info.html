                <p>
                    This article is a wild growing grocery and is commonly found in woodlands with lots of other fruits, berries and mushrooms. The whole mushroom is edible and has a good taste that is slightly stronger than mushrooms and with a peppery aftertaste. The food is also sold to large households in a dried state and the color will then be slightly darker.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Quality requirements for fruits will depend on the individual variety, but as a general rule, vegetables must be whole and juicy, and free from dark spots and pressure damage. Hat and stem must hang together. The mushroom should be full of juice and have a variety-typical shape. Wild growing berries must be free of snails and other pests.
