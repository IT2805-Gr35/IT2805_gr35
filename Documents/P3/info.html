                    Apple is a fruit known since the Stone Age and is found today in an unknown number of varieties. The apple originally comes from Asia and we know the fruit from the biblical story, where Eve tempts Adam with a fruit from the tree of knowledge.

                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>
                    Apple is eaten naturally. The taste will vary somewhat according to the different varieties and degree of ripeness, but also the individual ratio of acid, sugar and flavoring substances. Apple is used in fruit salads, for cheese, or in pies. Roasted or baked apples with nuts and raisins are recommended, not to forget applesauce, applesauce and apple cake.

                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    Apple has a high dietary fiber content which is beneficial for digestion. When it comes to vitamins and minerals, the apple does not have such a high content, but since we eat apples quite regularly, it still has an impact on our diet. Apples have the most vitamin C just under the skin, so eat apples with the skin on. Storage apples contain somewhat more vitamin C than the early varieties. Vitamin C strengthens the immune system and increases the absorption of iron from other foods.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Apple must be firm in consistency and free from impact damage. It must be whole, have the stem on, and be free of signs of shrinkage or dark spots. The quality can vary in relation to variety and place of cultivation, but the size in the box must be uniform. It is also worth noting that most Norwegian varieties should have a long and hot summer to get the best taste and appearance.

                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    1 - 2Â°C. Shelf life of apples can vary somewhat in relation to variety, country of cultivation and storage conditions. Apples can be stored for months in warehouses suitable for this, so the table deals with storage in the store. Apples harvested early have a somewhat shorter shelf life than the later varieties that are harvested towards the end of September. For all storage, it is important to keep the temperature as low as possible and have the right humidity.</p>
