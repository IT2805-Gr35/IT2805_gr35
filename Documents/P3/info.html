                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>Chanterelle is a wild growing mushroom and is commonly found in woodlands with lots of moss. Chanterelle is completely yellow, both on cap and stem. The hat is smooth on the top, and the brim is unevenly wavy.
                    On the underside of the hat are rib-shaped thick discs that continue down the stem. The stem is 3 to 6 cm long and is dense and fleshy. The flesh is white and firm. The whole mushroom is edible and has a good taste that is slightly stronger than mushrooms and with a peppery aftertaste. Chanterelle is also sold to large households in a dried state and the color will then be slightly darker.

                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>

                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    Chanterelle has a low energy and fat content and a high content of niacin, selenium, copper and dietary fibre. Chanterelle is also a source of beta-carotene, riboflavin, iron and potassium. Niacin helps to reduce fatigue and exhaustion, while selenium helps to maintain normal hair and nails. Beta-carotene is converted into vitamin A in the body. Vitamin A helps to maintain normal skin and normal vision. Riboflavin contributes to normal energy metabolism, while iron contributes to normal transport of oxygen in the body. Potassium helps maintain normal blood pressure.
                    
                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Quality requirements for mushrooms will depend on the individual variety, but as a general rule, mushrooms must be whole and juicy, and free from dark spots and pressure damage. Hat and stem must hang together. The mushroom should be full of juice and have a variety-typical shape. Wild growing mushrooms must be free of snails and other pests.
