                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>Grapes originally come from Asia where they have been known for over 5,000 years, and are one of the oldest fruits we know. Today, grapes are one of the most cultivated fruits in the world.
                    There are thousands of grape varieties, and it is most common to distinguish between green, red and blue, and between table grapes and wine grapes. Of what is harvested from grapes, only 10% is eaten naturally. A full 80% goes to wine and spirits production and the rest to raisins, juice and canning. Taste, consistency and size vary depending on the variety, and there are also stone-free varieties. Grapes do not ripen after harvesting and must therefore be harvested ripe.
