                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>The name orange comes from the German Apfelsine, which means Chinese apple. From the 16th century, the orange plant became known in Europe as an ornamental shrub, while fruit production started in Europe at the beginning of the 19th century.
                    Orange originally originates from China. Our name for the fruit comes from the German Apfelsine, which means Chinese apple. From the 16th century, the plant is known in Europe as an ornamental shrub, while fruit production started in Europe at the beginning of the 19th century.
                    
                    Oranges are usually divided into two main groups called blond and red. Blond oranges have a yellow pulp. Red oranges have a more or less red flesh. There are many different orange varieties, some are grown for fresh consumption, while others are grown only to make juice. Over a third of the production goes to juice production. Orange is the world's most important tree fruit. Good oranges are available all year round, but the biggest season is from December to Easter. The fruit is imported from Spain, Egypt, South Africa and Chile, among others.

                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>
                    Oranges are eaten raw or squeezed into juice. Orange has a wide range of applications and is used for salad, fruit salad, sauce and garnish, to decorate sandwiches, ice cream or marmalade. When using the shell for marmalade, it is important to scrub this first to remove any remaining wax.

                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    Orange has a low content of both energy and fat, as well as a high content of vitamin C. Vitamin C strengthens the immune system and protects cells against oxidative stress. Vitamin C also helps to reduce fatigue and exhaustion and increases the absorption of iron from other foods. Oranges also have a high dietary fiber content, which is good for digestion.

                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    The orange must be fresh and have an even color without green spots. The pulp should appear firm with no signs of soft spots. Oranges must also be juicy and tasty, have a peel that comes off easily and contain few stones.

                    <br>
                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    2 - 4Â°C.
                    Oranges do not contain starch in the pulp and therefore cannot overripe. This means that the fruit is at its freshest and most ripe at the time it is harvested.</p>
