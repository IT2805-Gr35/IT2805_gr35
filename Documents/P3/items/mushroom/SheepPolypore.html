                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p> Sheep polypores are wild growing and have a white, grey-white or yellowish cap that is smooth and dry and often slightly wrinkled. Several mushrooms are sometimes grown together and the name comes from the fact that this mushroom has the same color as sheep and often appears "in a flock". The smell and taste are good and mild and the meat is firm. Mushrooms can be used in stews, soups or alone as a vegetable for meat, fish and poultry. Before use, unsightly parts and the lower part of the stem are cut away. Sand and soil are brushed away and the whole mushroom can be eaten.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Quality requirements for mushrooms will depend on the individual variety, but as a general rule, mushrooms must be whole and juicy, and free from dark spots and pressure damage. Hat and stem must hang together. The mushroom should be full of juice and have a variety-typical shape. Wild growing mushrooms must be free of snails and other pests.                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    Storage in the dark at 0 - 2°C provides a shelf life of 8 - 10 days.</p>
