                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>The raspberry plant originates from Central Asia and came to the Nordics at the beginning of the 18th century. In Norway, we distinguish between wild raspberries that grow in the forest and garden raspberries. Wild raspberries are smaller but have a stronger aroma than garden raspberries. Only garden raspberries are sold in the shops. Most common in Norway are red raspberries, but there are also black, yellow, orange and white raspberries.

                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>
                    Raspberries can be eaten naturally alone or together with other berries for ice cream or other desserts. Fresh raspberries can also be used as a decoration on shortcakes or together with other berries in a pie. Also delicious as a compote, for cheese, filling in soft cakes or rolls.                    <br>

                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    Raspberries are a source of vitamin C and also have a high content of dietary fibre. Vitamin C strengthens the immune system and increases the absorption of iron from other foods, while dietary fiber is beneficial for digestion.

                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Raspberries should be dry on the outside, but still juicy. They must also be whole and well-ripened. The color can vary from lighter red to dark red depending on the type of berry.                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    Raspberries are very sensitive to any kind of treatment. They have a very short shelf life and quickly become soft. For that reason, they are not suitable for storage. They should be frozen if they are to be stored for longer than a day.            </div>
