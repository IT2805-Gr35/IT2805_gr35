                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>Strawberries as we know them today are the result of a long cross-breeding process of various wild-growing strawberry plants. Strawberries have been known as wild wild strawberries in Europe since Roman times, but commercial cultivation began in the early 1800s. Read about the most common strawberry varieties below.
                    A crossing of the best strawberry plants from North and South America with the best European species led to the large, strongly scented and juicy strawberries as we know them today. A further development of the plant has led to thousands of different strawberry varieties to satisfy different climatic conditions in the growing country, taste characteristics, size and shelf life. Actually, the strawberry is a swollen flower base that contains tiny strawberry seeds, which botanically are nuts.

                    <h3>AREA OF USE</h3>
                    Strawberries are eaten naturally. Good together with milk, cream, sour cream and maybe a little sugar. Strawberries have many uses and can be used as a cake decoration, cake filling, in fruit salad, in milkshakes, for ice cream or for pickling. Strawberries can be frozen.                    <br>

                    <h3>PROPERTIES</h3>
                    
                    Strawberries have a high content of vitamin C, which strengthens the immune system and increases the absorption of iron from other foods. Strawberries are also a source of folate which helps to reduce fatigue and exhaustion, as well as dietary fiber which is beneficial for digestion.

                    The properties apply when consuming at least 100 g of the product.

                    <h3>QUALITY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    Strawberries must be dry, fresh, whole and shiny with no signs of pressure damage or rot attack. They should have developed a good, even color and should have the stem and sepals in place. There are large variations in shape and size between the different varieties, but all the berries in the same basket should be fairly uniform.                    <br>

                    <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                    Strawberries have a very short shelf life, and are not suitable for storage over several days. Then they should be frozen.            </div>
