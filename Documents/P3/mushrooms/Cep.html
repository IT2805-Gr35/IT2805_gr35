                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>The tubes on the underside of the cap are whitish on young mushrooms and gradually turn yellow. The pulp is firm and white. The taste is mild, sweet and nutty, and very good and suitable for many dishes. Boletus can only be found growing wild. It is prone to attack by insects so careful control is important. Soft consistency is a sign of insect infestation and the product cannot be used. Boletus has a short shelf life in its fresh state, but dried mushrooms can be obtained all year round. Boletus grows in both deciduous and coniferous forests and it grows throughout Norway. Norwegian season from July - October and imports from Sweden, Italy and France from August to November.
