        <p>Client name: Norsk Natur for Turister</p>

        <h2>3. Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the website is to endorse safe harvest of in-season wild berries, fruit and mushrooms. Thus, the website will attempt to make harvesting accessible to a wider audience, by lowering the knowledge threshold associated with harvest of edible goods. This is accomplished by giving information about which food-safe specimens are-, or will be, in season at a given time. This website is primarily directed towards English speaking tourists, international or national, looking to experience harvesting edible goods in the Norwegian nature. It will be directed at beginners, with no pervious harvesting experience required. </p>

        <h2>4. Navigation Structure</h2>
        <p>We decided for the navigational structure to use the same navbar on all the pages from this navbar you will be able to access all the pages on the website. This makes it possible to access all the pages from every page.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>5. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
        <p>The website is designed in such a way that all the pages will be very equal in form and color, this is to make the flow of the website smoother. We use a web friendly font and use a complimentary color and text style such that the website will be easy to read. There will be links to all the pages in the header and drop-down menus to access all the “more info” pages for all the plants. This means that you can get to all the pages from wherever you are.</p>

Further below the page will present fruit, berries, and mushrooms that are in season at the current moment. Furthermore, each article will have a light indicating whether the article is in season or not. Articles in season will appear on top of the page. As well as a navbar and footer.  </p>

        <h2>7. Minimum Requirements</h2>
        <p>We plan to fulfill the minimum requirements in the following way:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Christer will be in charge of implementing:
                <p>A Javascript function that shows the in-season elements at the homepage, and that adds visual feedback to the user if the element is in-season. If the element is in season, this function should display a green border around the element. If the element is close to coming in-season, or if the element is close to going out of season, the border should display yellow. to make it more appealing as well as providing the user with immediate information on what elements are in season. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Brage will be in charge of implementing:
                <p>A JavaScript function that fakes a response to the user when they submit a request for information on a plant on the “contact” page. This provides feedback to the user that their request has been received and then deletes their request. Since the page is for tourists that might not be familiar with Norwegian flora this will give them the opportunity to get information on any food-plant they might encounter, even if it’s not specifically listed on the website. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Vebjørn will be in charge of implementing:
                <p>A JavaScript function that works the search-bar on the site. Here users can navigate to any page on the site, as well as any page with information on a specific plant that they search for. This enhances the experience of looking for specific plants, so that users don't have to scroll through all the plants on the site to find what they are looking for. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Karl Emil will be in charge of implementing: 
                <p>A JavaScript for displaying a slideshow of pictures for any specific plant on their info-page. This makes the pages more interesting to users, as well as providing more visual material for the plants that users can use to identify them. The slideshow might also be used for the about-page to connect better with the users. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
